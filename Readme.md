How does it fit with Partisia Blockchain’s core value propositions of programmable privacy, interoperability and blockchain hyper-performance?  What part of the Partisia blockchain will you be using?

How does the Hackathon grants program work?

The deadline for the initial submission is November 14th and you can submit your proposal at any time before the deadline.  Once you submit your proposal, we will review and reply back within 3 business days.  If there are questions or clarifications we feel are needed, we will reach out to schedule a meeting or iterate through email. 

By November 25th, we will let you know if you are selected to be a participant in the on-site Paris event.  At the event, we will reserve 3 hours for 1:1 consultations with you in Paris, with tech, marketing and business model experts for further refinement of your proposal.  Please note: the attendance in Paris is optional and you can be a winner even if you can not attend in person.
