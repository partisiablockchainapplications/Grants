## Project Description
This is an **example** application for a grant programme: **Partisia Blockchain Grant Program: Partisia Blockchain Apps**

We intend to create a staking derivatives on Partisia Blockchain. More implementations will increase capital efficiecy in Partisia Blockchain and enable MPC staked to secure Partisia Blockchain to be used in other Partisia Blockchain applications such as DeFi, governance and games.

Our team has been closely following Ethereum DeFi and Partisia Blockchain in the last year, and are active in the chat channels. Needless to say, we are really excited to see this project evolve.

## Problem / Solution
MPC staked to secure Partisia Blockchain cannot be used in Partisia Blockchain ecosystem, creating a capital inefficiency. Staking derivatives (dxMPC) allows MPC holders to...

## Detailed product description
The components of staking derivatives (dxMPC) contract include a validator set module that determines validator participation, staking module which handles bonded tokens and liquidity pool.

## Go-to-Market plan
As dxMPC is a clear value proposition for existing MPC holders, we hope to promote this effort within the Partisia Blockchain community

## Value capture for Partisia Blockchain ecosystem
The main KPIs for Partisia Blockchain is TVL (privacy value add to other blockchain ecosystems), number of transactions and number of user (for applications)

## Development Roadmap
We will require 3 months to complete this project. We intend to hav 2 developers full-time and 1 part-time, at a total cost of $X,000.

Example milestones:
* Implement X (weeks 0 - 4).
* Implement Y (weeks 4 - 8).
* Implement Z (weeks 8 - 12).

Ideally, we can receive payments in 3 disbursements, one at the beginning of the grant, one after implementation of Y and last payment when the development work is completed.

We would be willing to consider part payment in MPCs, up to x%.
